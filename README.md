**Grapper** is a free and open-source **web component for data visualization**, designed as a
**low-level microframework** to create **custom, dynamic, and interactive visualizations** with 
**SVG + directives**. It offers **flexibility in design**, enabling unique and aesthetic 
visualizations far beyond the typical monotonous charts.

## Features

- **Microframework** — lightweight, no build step required  
- **Data-driven** — declarative binding between data and SVG  
- **Native** — built on top of `<svg>` with powerful directives (`g-for`, `g-bind`, `g-if`, `g-on`, …)  
- **Reactive** — smooth and efficient updates when data changes  
- **Configurable** — use JSON/JSON5 for palettes, margins, scales, etc.  
- **Extensible** — methods for interactivity, data transformation, and plugins

## Quick Example

This example demonstrates a very basic bar chart using `grapper-view`:

![example](./assets/img/example.png)

```html
<grapper-view id="example-starter">
  <template>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 200 100" width="200px" height="100px">
      <g stroke-width="12" stroke-linecap="round">
        <line g-for="(record, index) of data"
              x1="22"
              :x2="record.value"
              :y1="index * 20 + 30"
              :y2="index * 20 + 30"
              :stroke="record.color"/>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </template>
  <script type="data">
    [
      { "color": "#D80000", "value": 130 },
      { "color": "#00D800", "value": 170 },
      { "color": "#0000D8", "value": 100 }
    ]
  </script>
</grapper-view>
```

Grapper is based on SVG and directives, providing a **declarative way** to build **data-driven
graphics**. This approach allows designers and developers to focus on **visual storytelling** with
**smooth rendering** and **high runtime performance** — all with a **tiny footprint** and **no
pre-compilation**.

## From Graphane 1.0.x to Grapper 1.1.x

Grapper is the **next version of Graphane**.  
The project was renamed to avoid conflicts with other products and improve discoverability.

Existing Graphane projects will continue to run, but **new projects should use Grapper**.  
[Migration](https://grapper.io/guide/in-depth/migration-from-graphane.html) is straightforward and
can be incremental.
